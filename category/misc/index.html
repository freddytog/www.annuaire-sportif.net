		<p>Learning to win at slot machines is an incredibly difficult task. It is somewhat of an elusive goal for many players across the globe who are constantly looking for different ways to beat such slots. Winning consistently on slot machines is a hard goal to accomplish. These games are designed in such a way that the possibility of winning it big remains a million to one odds.&nbsp;<a href="https://onlinecasinopolis.de/double-triple-chance-online-kostenlos-spielen/"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; white-space: pre-wrap;">Double Triple Chance</span></a> slot is no exception.</p>

<p>It is a known fact that casino games earn money for the house by paying less than the true odds of winning a bet. There are more than thousands and sometimes millions of reel combinations in money slots online. For example, in a three reel slot alone with 10 symbol reels, there exists a maximum of 1000 possible combinations. The crossover to virtual reels in recent times has enabled that every 100 stops on each of three reels come with a whopping 1 million combinations. That is quite a lot if you ask.</p>

<p>Slot machines today account for 70% of all gaming revenue. All the gaming machines have been designed to pay back a certain percentage of wins which varies from game to game. So as such there is a natural curiosity amongst people to know the different ways to win on slots and also if there are any systems in place that can beat slot machines? While these questions are relevant but the truth is that there is not much you can do to change the odds on slot machines, at least not legally but there does exist some ways where you can actually beat the slots at their own game. These are some tried and tested methods that have been tested out by players which are per se not sworn by any experts. These methods, however, have been tried and tested by different online players who have tasted success.</p>

<h2>Determine Your Current Bankroll</h2>

<p>This is the first and foremost thing a player needs to consider before playing an online slot. Begin by setting an individual limit for yourself. A good rule of thumb before setting such a limit is to set aside a certain sum of money that you are prepared to lose. Go with an assumption that you are going to be losing all your money since you are playing against a slot with distinct combinations that doesn’t in any way guarantee you a win. This will help you give a fair indication of how much money you can actually afford to lose in the process of playing the slot. Once that is concluded, ensure that you adhere to this rule and deposit only that sum of money you have decided upon.</p>

<h2>Know Your Slots</h2>

<p>The second important thing that a player needs to understand is the slot they are playing. There are countless different variations of games in the market, each one with a different offering than the last and each with its own set of rules, bonuses, and jackpots. Even if you think you have found a pokie familiar to your last one, make a point to read about the game thoroughly. Learn about the payline and what it has to offer, the maximum bets, etc. The last thing you want to do is ruin your playing experience in favor of a game that you chose not to read about and understand properly.</p>

<h2>Play Maximum Coins</h2>

<p>Yes, you read it right. For every slot, you put your mind into, ensure that you play the maximum amount of coins in the slot. Not doing so can hurt your chances at winning. Always opt for the maximum coins on your play to ensure that you don’t lose out on winning the jackpot. Any online player is but obviously looking for a slot with the highest payout percentage that guarantees them big wins. A machine not paying out any wins doesn’t in any way imply that it is not ready for a jackpot as this is all a game of chance and probability. Every spin made by you, therefore, is bound to be independent and random of past spins made by you.</p>

<h2>Don’t Be Afraid To Switch</h2>

<p>Now, there are some players who will spend hours at end tirelessly pumping coins into the same machine and still come up empty. Most of these players are afraid of walking away from the game thinking that it’s about to get interesting and that their luck will favor them soon enough. Never fall into such a trap and if you feel that you are losing on a continuous basis in the game then make sure you move on to some other game. There would be wide varieties of game you would be playing on the portal you have registered. Try out some other game. Who knows your luck might improve in the next game. Worst case scenario. You at least have a change in the scenery away from the monotony of the last game that wasn’t yielding any results. Unlike land-based casinos today, with an online casino slot, all you need to do is close your current tab and look out for the next best alternative available to you</p>
